/*
Recursion: it is a problem-solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

we can say recursion is when a function calls itself

A few points no note:
---------------------
1. every recursive solution needs to have a base case a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion.

if you don't have a base case you'll have an infinite loop which can crash your program

2. recursion might simplify solving the problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution

a recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution
