Algorithm analysis: 
------------------
There are multiple ways to solve a problem.
Ex: there are multiple ways to sort a list of numbers
How do we analyse which one of them is the most efficient algorithm?

Generally, when we talk about performance, we use an absolute measure. if i can run 100 meters in 12 seconds, I am faster than someone who takes 15 seconds. But analysing algrorithms is a bit different.

The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted since it depends on a number of factors.
