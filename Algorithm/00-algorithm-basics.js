/* 
Algorithm: 
----------
An Algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a paticular problem.

example: sum of 2 numbers
input- a, b
add number using + and return value
Output sum of a and b

Characteristics:
----------------
1. Well defined inputs and outputs:
in our example input is a, b and output is sum of a and b. no confusion about that.

2. Each step should be clear and unambigous:
in our example there are steps to solve the problem add number using + and return value. the step is very clear.

3. Language independent:
it should be written in a way that can be implemented by any programming language.


Why Algorithms?
---------------
As a developer, you are going to come across problems that you need to solve. 
learning algorithms translate to learning defferent techniques to efficiently solve those poroblems.

Note:
-----
One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms.
Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance.
